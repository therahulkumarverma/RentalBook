					Online book-rental services save time by delivering books to a
					member's home or office. In addition to convenience, the service
					also offers an ease-of-use benefit; membership on most websites
					involves a simple registration form and payment through bank
					transfer or cash on delivery. This is important in a market that
					does not yet trust internet-based monetary transactions. Once
					membership is paid the user logs in to browse books, and clicks the
					"rent" button to receive the chosen books at home. The books are
					collected when the user logs in to indicate that he or she has
					finished reading. Another advantage of online rental services is
					that most do not have any due dates or late fees; borrowers may
					keep books for as long as they wish, provided they pay the regular
					subscription. This era is changing, edits being made with education
					book selling. Engineering books are often taken on rent for a
					semester or 2 and returned after use.</br><br> With the online space
					roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting. In
					engineering book stores, you order books and pay Cash on Delivery,
					after usage you collect back up to 70% of the invoice back.Yes, we
					deliver books home. For our online members, all deliveries and pick
					ups are free of charge. For members who sign up at our physical
					stores, we offer one or two free deliveries a month depending on
					the duration of the membership. For any additional deliveries,
					there is a nominal charge of Rs. 25 per delivery. Please contact
					the front desk of your branch for further details.</p>
